# Project Cleanup Task

## Steps:
- [x] Remove junk root files (ngrok tools, dev scripts, misnamed package, query).
- [x] Clean old test images in public/uploads.
- [] Create/update TODO.md with cleanup steps.
- [] Refactor server.js: Remove legacy /signup route (unused in current flow).
- [] Refactor public/create-campaign.html: Remove redundant JS functions (backToGrid, backToBannerGrid).
- [] Test: Run 'npm start' to verify server starts without errors.
- [] Test: Launch browser to http://localhost:3000/create-campaign.html, confirm no auth issues or errors (may need login).
- [] Complete cleanup and confirm smooth run.
